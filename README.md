Richard Chun - Web Development - Fall 2017

About me:

I'm a Computer Science graduate student with undergrad in Marketing who's seeking to combine my business and analytical skills with my most recent technical skills to work as a web developer in an innovative web development company. That is to say how CS5610 is important to me. Before my CS program, I worked as a market researcher at Nielsen Brazil.

I don't have much experience with CS and so far, I have only worked on small projects. The most remarkable project has been the Boston Public School Transporation Challenge that we took in our Managing Software Development course here at Northeastern. It was basically about reducing the school costs with their transportation system and we were required to build a software system that could optimize their bus routing system and reduce the number of buses required on the streets. Finally, I'm really looking forward to starting my first Web Dev Project as I believe I will learn many things I need for a web developer position when I start searching for coops.

This Repository is to store and display all my work in CS5610 Web Development.
